                <p>We had been visiting the shelter for months waiting for the perfect pup. The dogs are always barking and jumping like crazy. We turned the corner and Dash was sitting there quiet as a mouse wagging his tail like crazy looking at us with his big brown eyes and floppy ears. It was love at first sight!"

                <p>Alvin came from the Animal Shelter. she had run away from 3 previous foster homes and I followed her story through Facebook, her last run away left him lost for 7 weeks. When we saw that she made it back we went to "foster" her. Haha signed the adoption papers the day we got her 2 years ago.

                <p>Trip here got hit by a car when he was just a small puppy. A lady found him in a parking lot with his hind leg severely broken. The vet said it needed to be amputated â€” they'd do it for free as a "good practice surgery" if they could find someone to take him afterward. We said we would take him.</p>
